Charter for Working Group

The CoRE Working Group (WG) provides a framework for resource-oriented applications intended to run on constrained IP networks. A constrained IP network may have additional constraints compared to normal IP networks such as limited packet sizes, and a high degree of packet loss. These networks and the nodes within them are characterized by severe limits on throughput, available power, and particularly on the complexity that can be supported with limited code size or limited RAM per node [RFC 7228]. Constrained networks can occur as part of home and building automation, energy management, and the Internet of Things.

The CoRE WG will define a framework for a limited class of applications: those that deal with the manipulation of simple resources on constrained networks. This includes applications to monitor simple sensors (e.g., temperature sensors, light sensors, and power meters), to control actuators (e.g., light switches, heating controllers, and door locks), and to manage devices.

The general architecture targeted by the CoRE WG framework consists of nodes on the constrained network, called Devices, that are responsible for one or more Resources that may represent sensors, actuators, combinations of values, and/or other information. Devices send messages to change and query resources on other Devices. A Device can send notifications about changed resource values to Devices that have expressed their interest to receive notification about changes. A Device can also publish or be queried about its resources. 

As part of the framework for building these applications, the CoRE WG has defined the Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) for the manipulation of Resources on a Device. CoAP is designed for use between Devices on the same constrained network, between Devices and general nodes on the Internet, and between Devices on different constrained networks both joined by an internet.

There also may be intermediary nodes acting as proxies that possibly also interconnect between other Internet protocols and the Devices using the CoAP protocol. It is worth noting that a proxy does not have to occur at the boundary between the constrained network and the more general network, but can be deployed at various locations in the less-constrained network. The CoRE WG will continue to evolve the support of proxies for CoAP to increase their practical applicability.

CoAP supports various forms of "caching". Beyond the benefits of caching already well known from REST, caching can be used to increase energy savings of low-power nodes by allowing them to be normally-off [RFC 7228]. For example, a temperature sensor might wake up every five minutes and send the current temperature to a proxy that has expressed interest in notifications. When the proxy receives a request over CoAP or HTTP for that temperature resource, it can respond with the last notified value, instead of trying to query the Device which may not be reachable at this time. The CoRE WG will continue to evolve this model to increase its practical applicability.

The CoRE WG has completed a set of standards-track specifications building on the CoAP specification [RFC 7252] and will perform maintenance as well as possible updating and complementing the framework in areas of resource discovery, group communication, data formats, operation and management, and CoAP related security.

Candidate work items include:

* evolve the support for CoAP group communication originally developed in the Experimental RFC 7390(but not develop a solution for reliable multicast delivery of CoAP messages)

* continue defining transport mappings for alternative transports as required, both IP-based and non IP-based 

* solutions to facilitate the signalling of transports available to a Device.

* continue and complete its work on the CoRE Resource Directory 

* consideration of interoperability with DNS-SD and the work of the dnssd WG. 

* use of CoAP to transport DNS queries and responses will also be investigated. 

* enabling broker-based publish-subscribe-style communication over CoAP

* related data formats, such as alternative representations of RFC 6690 link

* Constrained Resource Identifiers for serializing URI components in CBOR

* develop CoRAL, a constrained RESTful application language intended for driving automated software agents that navigate a Web application

* complete the Sensor Measurement Lists (SenML) set of specifications

* continuing to examine operational and manageability aspects of the CoAP protocol itself

* complete the work on RESTCONF-style management functions available via CoAP that are appropriate for constrained node networks 

* efficiency of DTLS as the basis for the communication security in CoAP

* preferred cipher suites in cooperation with the TLS WG and CFRG.

* complete the work on the Group OSCORE protocol that enables protection of CoAP messages in group communication environments. 

* optimization-oriented profiling of the EDHOC protocol to establish security material for OSCORE 

* perform maintenance as well as possible updating and complementing of the (Group) OSCORE documents above as required.

* solutions on authentication and authorization may need complementary elements on the CoRE side.

The CoRE WG will coordinate:

* with other IETF WGs, particularly of the constrained node networks cluster (6Lo, 6TiSCH, LWIG, ROLL, ACE, CBOR, COSE, IOTOPS, LAKE, SUIT, ASDF),

* with further appropriate groups in the IETF OPS and Security Areas, 

* with the IRTF Thing-to-Thing Research Group, and

* with other SDOs building on CoAP such as OMA Specworks.
